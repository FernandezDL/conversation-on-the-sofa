Amy: I made you a coffee...

    Amy: I didn't know if you were going to come...

+ [Just like we used to do...]
    Amy: Just like we used to do...
    Ethan: Sometimes I wonder what happened to us
    ->nostalgia1

=== neutral1 ===
Ethan: Thanks for the coffee. 
Ethan: I wasn't sure if I should come either, but here I am.

+[I'm glad you did]
    Amy: I'm glad you did, I think there are things to talk about.
    Ethan: I'm glad too
    Ethan: Although I don't know if we're too late to talk...
    ->neutral2
    
+[I didn't expect you to do it for me]
    Amy: I didn't expect you to do it for me
    Amy: Perhaps you came out of pity
    Ethan: It's not pity, but I wouldn't know what it is, exactly....
    Amy: Then you don't know why you're here either...
    Amy: That scares me more than pity.
    Ethan: I couldn't not be here, even if I don't know what else to say.

+[You don't seem to want to stay and you don't want to leave either.]
    Amy: It's just that... I'm having a hard time seeing your motivation. 
    Amy: You don't seem to want to stay and you don't want to leave either.

Ethan: Do you want me to go?

+[Yes]
    Amy: Yes, it's not worth it to keep hurting each other.
    ->silence
    
+[I don't know]
    Amy: I don't know if I want you to leave or stay different...
    -> silence

=== neutral2 ===
+[We were late for a lot of things]
    Amy: We were late for a lot of things
    Amy: And talking was never our strength.
    Ethan: Maybe that's why we're here, to try one last time.
    Amy: I don't know if this will make a difference
    Amy: But maybe it can help me to let go of what was hurting.
    Ethan: And me to look back without so much noise
    Ethan: At least now... it hurts differently.
    ->silence
    
+[Maybe]
    Amy: Maybe so, but I don't want to be left in doubt.
    Ethan: So let's not keep quiet today
    ->realism1

=== realism1 ===
+[Why did you walk away so far without saying anything?]
    Amy: Why did you walk away so far without saying anything?
    Ethan: Because I didn't know how to stay without breaking you more
    ->pain1
    
+[Did you love me?]
    Amy: Did you love me?
    Ethan: Yes, but I got lost on the way, I forgot who I was.

    ->silence
    
+[Was there someone else?]
    Amy: Was there someone else? 
    Amy: Sometimes I thought about it, and I can't stay in doubt.
    Ethan: No, there was no one else. 
    Ethan: But for you to ask... that really hurts me.
    Ethan: If you doubt me, it's because I failed in something
    Ethan: And I'm sorry I made you stop feeling safe with me.
    Amy: I just needed to know, thank you
    ->silence
    
=== pain1 ===
+[I didn't need you to be perfect]
    Amy: I didn't need you to be perfect, I just didn't need you to disappear quietly.
    Ethan: And I needed you to see me, even if I didn't know how to show myself.
    Amy: We didn't talk when we had the time, but at least we talked about it
    Ethan: If we can't go back, at least we can close this chapter well.
    -> lowerLook
    
+[Then maybe you were right to leave]
    Amy: Then maybe you were right to leave, at least a part of me was left whole.
    Ethan: I will never forgive myself for having broken the other part.

=== insecurity1 ===
Ethan: It was hard to do if I didn't know if you wanted me there.

+[Maybe neither of us knew how to stay]
    Amy: Maybe neither of us knew how to stay and that's why we are now so broken...
    Ethan: Yeah, maybe
    Ethan: Do you think it's time to end it? Before it hurts more?
    Amy: Yes...
    ->silence

+[It wasn't that I didn't love you.]
    Amy: It wasn't that I didn't love you, it was that I didn't know how to ask you to stay.

+[I don't wat to keep quiet anymore]
    Amy: I don't know if it's too late, but I don't want to keep quiet anymore.
    Ethan: Then don't. What if we talk for real?
    -> silence
    
+[And now I don't know if there's still something to talk about...]
    Amy: And now I don't know if there's still something to talk about...
    Ethan: Maybe not, but at least we're talking about it now.
    -> silence

=== acceptance1 ===
Ethan: I think we both fail in that

+[Do you think we would be in a different place if we had talked earlier?]
    Amy: Do you think we would be in a different place if we had talked earlier?
    Ethan: I don't know. But I would have liked to know.

    Ethan: Even if it hurts, that was our reality...

Ethan: Again with that...

+ [It is the reality that we have lived for a long time]

    Amy: You know what? Sometimes I wish your life with me was enough
    Amy: But I see it's not...
    Ethan: I wanted that, too
    Ethan: But it seems I wasn't invited into your plans.

    Amy: If it's a subject you bring up so much, there must be some truth to it.
    Ethan: Wow... You really think that about me...
    Ethan: Do you really think that...? You know what? I don't think this is going anywhere.
    Ethan: At this point, I think it is no longer useful to talk or fight.
    -> goodbye

=== anger1 ===
+[My reality?]
    Amy: My reality? Yours was to keep quiet about everything
    Amy: And then pretend that you were here
    Ethan: And yours was to say everything was fine
    Ethan: And then treating me like I was in the way.
    Ethan: You're not the only one who put up with things, Amy.
    Ethan: But your stuff was always more important, wasn't it?
    
    ->slap

+[This is getting nowhere...]
    Amy: You know what? This is getting nowhere...
    Amy: You've made your decision, and I'm not in it.
    Ethan: I never said that

    Amy: Maybe, but that's the way it's felt for a long time.
